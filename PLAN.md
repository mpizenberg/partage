- ✅ Supports offline-first operation with pending queue
- ✅ Full TypeScript type safety across all modules
- ✅ Production-ready cryptography foundation

### Phase 2: Local CRDT & Data Models (Weeks 3-4)
**Goal**: Loro integration and local data operations

**Tasks**:
1. Define shared types (`/packages/shared/src/types/`):
   - `group.ts`, `member.ts`, `entry.ts`, `balance.ts`
2. Implement Loro wrapper (`/packages/client/src/core/crdt/loro-wrapper.ts`):
   - Two-layer approach: Loro for metadata, encrypted payloads for sensitive data
   - Entry operations: create, modify, delete
   - Versioning system for modifications
3. Implement balance calculator (`/packages/client/src/domain/calculations/`):
   - Calculate balances from entries
   - Debt graph computation
   - Settlement plan optimization
4. Write unit tests for CRDT and calculations

**Critical Files**:
- `/packages/client/src/core/crdt/loro-wrapper.ts`
- `/packages/shared/src/types/entry.ts`
- `/packages/client/src/domain/calculations/balance-calculator.ts`

**Deliverable**: Can create encrypted entries in Loro, calculate balances locally

### Phase 3: Basic UI (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Local-only MVP with working UI

**Tasks**:
1. Set up SolidJS app with Vite
2. Create base CSS structure (mobile-first)
3. Implement screens:
   - Group creation
   - Entry creation form (expense & transfer)
   - Entry list view
   - Balance overview
4. Wire up UI to local CRDT operations
5. Test single-user flows end-to-end

**Deliverable**: Working MVP for single user, no sync

### Phase 4: Server & Sync (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal**: Multi-device synchronization

**Tasks**:
1. Set up PocketBase server (`/packages/server/`):
   - Collections schema for encrypted operations
   - Real-time subscriptions
2. Implement API client (`/packages/client/src/api/pocketbase-client.ts`)
3. Implement sync manager (`/packages/client/src/core/sync/sync-manager.ts`):
   - Push local operations to server
   - Pull and apply remote operations
   - Online/offline detection
   - Operation queue for offline support
   - Conflict resolution via Loro CRDTs
4. Test multi-client sync (multiple browser tabs)

**Critical Files**:
- `/packages/client/src/core/sync/sync-manager.ts`
- `/packages/client/src/api/pocketbase-client.ts`

**Deliverable**: Two browser tabs can sync changes in real-time

### Phase 5: Multi-User Features (Weeks 11-12)
**Goal**: Enable group collaboration

**Tasks**:
1. Invite link generation and joining flow
2. Member identification (new vs existing)
3. Public key exchange
4. Group key versioning and rotation
5. Member management UI
6. Historical key sharing for recovery

**Deliverable**: Multiple users can join groups and collaborate

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Weeks 13-16)
**Goal**: Complete feature set

**Tasks**:
1. Entry modification with versioning
2. Entry soft deletion
3. Activity feed
4. Filtering and search
5. Multi-currency support with exchange rates
6. Settlement suggestions (debt optimization)
7. Export functionality (JSON)
8. PWA service worker for offline

**Deliverable**: Full-featured application

### Phase 7: Polish (Weeks 17-20)
**Goal**: Production readiness

**Tasks**:
1. Error handling and loading states
2. Mobile UX refinement
3. User onboarding flow
4. Security audit
5. Performance optimization
6. Deployment setup

## Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. Encrypted Data in Loro
**Approach**: Two-layer structure
- Loro stores metadata (id, timestamp, actor, version) - unencrypted
- Sensitive data stored as encrypted payload (Base64 string) - encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Signatures verify authenticity
- Server relays Loro updates without seeing content

### 2. Versioning System
**Pattern**: Immutable entries with version references
- Each modification creates new version
- `previousVersionId` links to prior version
- All versions retained for audit trail
- UI shows latest version, can view history

### 3. Currency Handling
**Strategy**: Store both original and converted amounts
- Capture exchange rate at transaction time
- Store: `amount` (original), `currency`, `defaultCurrencyAmount`, `exchangeRate`
- Balance calculations use `defaultCurrencyAmount`
- Historical accuracy preserved

### 4. Key Management
**Flow**:
- User keypair: Generated on first launch, stored in IndexedDB
- Group keys: Versioned, rotated on member join/leave
- Historical keys: Retained for decrypting old data
- Key sharing: Encrypted with recipient's public key

### 5. Sync Protocol
**Design**:
- Server: Append-only log of encrypted operations
- Client: Subscribe to real-time updates via PocketBase
- Offline: Queue operations locally, sync on reconnect
- Conflicts: Loro CRDT handles automatically

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
- **Crypto**: 100% coverage, test vectors, tampering detection
- **Storage**: IndexedDB operations, key persistence
- **CRDT**: Concurrent operations, convergence
- **Calculations**: Balance computation, edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Entry creation flow (UI → crypto → CRDT → storage)
- Multi-client sync scenarios
- Offline/online transitions
- Key rotation flows

### Mock Strategy
- Mock PocketBase for sync testing
- Mock IndexedDB for storage testing
- Test data generators for large datasets
