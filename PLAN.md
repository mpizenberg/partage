### Phase 8: Polish & Production
**Goal**: Production readiness

**Tasks**:
1. PWA service worker for full offline support
2. Error handling and loading states
3. Mobile UX refinement
4. User onboarding flow
5. Security audit
6. Performance optimization
7. Deployment setup

## Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. Encrypted Data in Loro
**Approach**: Two-layer structure
- Loro stores metadata (id, timestamp, actor, version) - unencrypted
- Sensitive data stored as encrypted payload (Base64 string) - encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Signatures verify authenticity
- Server relays Loro updates without seeing content

### 2. Versioning System
**Pattern**: Immutable entries with version references
- Each modification creates new version
- `previousVersionId` links to prior version
- All versions retained for audit trail
- UI shows latest version, can view history

### 3. Currency Handling
**Strategy**: Store both original and converted amounts
- Capture exchange rate at transaction time
- Store: `amount` (original), `currency`, `defaultCurrencyAmount`, `exchangeRate`
- Balance calculations use `defaultCurrencyAmount`
- Historical accuracy preserved

### 4. Key Management
**Flow**:
- User keypair: Generated on first launch, stored in IndexedDB
- Group keys: Versioned, rotated on member join/leave
- Historical keys: Retained for decrypting old data
- Key sharing: Encrypted with recipient's public key

### 5. Sync Protocol
**Design**:
- Server: Append-only log of encrypted operations
- Client: Subscribe to real-time updates via PocketBase
- Offline: Queue operations locally, sync on reconnect
- Conflicts: Loro CRDT handles automatically

### 6. Snapshot Storage Strategy
**Design**: Incremental updates with periodic consolidation
- **Base snapshots**: Full Loro CRDT state stored in IndexedDB per group
- **Incremental updates**: After each mutation, store only the delta (1-10 KB) instead of full snapshot (10 MB)
- **Consolidation triggers**:
  - Every 50 incremental updates (threshold-based)
  - On app load (always, for clean startup)
  - On idle (when user switches tabs)
- **Performance**: ~98% reduction in IndexedDB write volume
- **Rationale**: Encrypted data is incompressible, so delta updates are the only way to reduce writes

**Why not server-side snapshots yet?**
- Phase 6 focuses on local performance optimization
- Server-side snapshots planned for future (reduces initial sync time for large groups)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest)
- **Crypto**: 100% coverage, test vectors, tampering detection
- **Storage**: IndexedDB operations, key persistence
- **CRDT**: Concurrent operations, convergence
- **Calculations**: Balance computation, edge cases

### Integration Tests
- Entry creation flow (UI → crypto → CRDT → storage)
- Multi-client sync scenarios
- Offline/online transitions
- Key rotation flows

### Mock Strategy
- Mock PocketBase for sync testing
- Mock IndexedDB for storage testing
- Test data generators for large datasets
